Hey! Welcome to my site.. I guess sort of a blog. I think the main purpose of this site is for me to document my journey, mostly my professional one. 

A little bit about myself, I've been really into computers since a relatively young age, tinkering with them and figuring out how to take it apart, put it back together. How to customize the operating system. This all led me to pursue it as a career and go to school to broaden my knowledge.

I've worked mostly in start-ups, or companies that are just past that start-up stage. I've done everything from help desk, data center, and operations. I'm currently a System Administrator, and pursuing to move onto Site Reliability Engineers.

To aid in achieving my goals, I've pursued and am actively pursuing professional certifications.

So far I've accomplished RHCSA and Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer.
