One thing that I felt always held me back, was that I didn't attend a popular university for Computer Science. Instead, I took a 2 year college diploma program for Computer Systems Technology, and while I learned quite a bit. It didn't help me too much with landing the job I wanted. They did offer co-op in their 3 year program, but I didn't take advantage of that.

I knew I wanted to do more, and to get there, I'd need to learn more. Sometimes you can be lucky and find a company that values individual growth and provides many opportunities to learn on the job. Other times, there isn't enough of it, so how do you get to the next milestone in your career, or learn more about areas that interest you? How do you even find what areas might interest you if you had no exposure?

I worked at a financial company, and knew that I wanted to move more on the infrastructure side of things, as I was mostly involved with monitoring and internal IT support. Every year, I'd have my performance review, and speak about where I want to go. Each year, I'd get closer to defining what that is. By my second annual review, I had voiced that I wanted to work towards joining the DevOps team. Feedback on how to get there was very little. On my third annual review, I came in with a
game plan. I knew that I needed more Linux experience, and more cloud experience, specifically AWS at the time to match what we were using in production.

The problem was, I didn't know how I would get that. I had some Linux experience, mostly running basic commands and troubleshooting. I had almost no cloud experience, on any platform.

My third annual review, went slightly better than the ones in my past. I was not much clearer on how I would get to where I wanted to go, but I had a path forward. I agreed to getting RHCSA, and an AWS certification.

I was lucky to have stumbled across a site called <a href="https://linuxacademy.com">Linux Academy</a>. I've tried <a href="https://udemy.com">Udemy</a> courses in the past, they would often go on sales for 10$ or even free. However, these were very static, could be outdated, and you didn't generally have a sense of structure, community or a strong sense of how you were fairing in the course.

My first course on Linux Academy (LA), was their Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator course, taught by Anthony James (LA's founder). The very first video, was an introduction to the course, what to expect, followed by an introduction to the course instructor. This structure reminded me of my college days. 

I setup a course schedule, which allows you to configure a certain pace as to how much content to get through in a day and reach your goal of finishing the course. It's a useful feature, but everything can be self paced, so if you're like me and not always so organized (Work In Progress), it isn't required that you set this up.

One thing that stood out to me, was that they offer interactive labs, and also Cloud VMs. They allow you have a certain number of persistent VMs. These VMs do get stopped (offline) after you are logged out. But any work you do in them is persistent and will be available the next time you log in.

The content, labs, access to VMs that are included in your subscription at no extra cost, was extremely valuable. However, there was something else that I found to be even more valuable. The community. They have a Slack community that is really responsive, you can get answers, feedback and often times, very good advice and insight. When I completed the course for RHCSA, and took the exam, I was surprised how prepared I was. Online resources were always raving about how difficult the
exam is. I was getting anxiety that I may not be ready. I passed with a 283/300 after studying for 1 month, with just Linux Academy alone. However as I mentioned, I did have some Linux experience. 

After receiving my certificate, and posting my achievement on LA's website, under their community section, I received many congratulations from other students and many of their instructors, many of them asking me what's my next goal etc. It felt good, it made me want to learn more. I now have nearly 20 courses on LA complete. I got a second certification, Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer, and am scheduled to take my Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect on April 2nd.

Linux Academy offers 2 subscription models (prices at the time of this writing):
* Annual (449 USD)
* Monthly (49 USD)

The pricing is definitely steep, I paid for the monthly subscription as I was funding it myself, that was in December 2018, and paid up until April 2019 when I landed a Linux Systems Administrator job. They ended up paying for my annual subscription (Thanks <a href="https://freshbooks.com">Freshbooks</a>)

If you're looking to take the next step in your career, and find yourself needing some help. I definitely recommend <a href="https://linuxacademy.com">Linux Academy</a> They do have discounted subscriptions throughout the year which generally cuts the annual subscription down to 299 USD. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/linuxacademyCOM">@linuxacademyCOM</a> on Twitter as they tweet about their deals when they come up.
